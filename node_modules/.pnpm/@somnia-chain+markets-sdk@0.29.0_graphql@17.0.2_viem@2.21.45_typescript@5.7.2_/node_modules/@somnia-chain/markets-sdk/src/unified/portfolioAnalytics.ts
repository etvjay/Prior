// Portfolio analytics — the equity curve / PnL / MWRR / volume metrics plane
// a portfolio page renders, computed purely from indexed activity + candle
// marks. Upstreamed from the DreamDex gateway's GET /v0/portfolio when the
// app moved onto the SDK as its sole data source.
//
// House split: a PURE kernel over typed flow events (this file) + exchange
// wiring that assembles the events from indexer reads. The kernel is
// deliberately event-shaped rather than fill-shaped so the perp account
// plane (funding payments, margin moves) can join the same fold later as new
// event kinds — an equity curve folded from fills alone stops being true the
// day funding exists.
//
// Accounting: weighted-average cost per market. Realized PnL accrues on
// sells (proceeds − avg cost of the size sold); unrealized marks the open
// quantity to the nearest candle close at-or-before each sample.
//
// The MWRR capital base has two definitions, and the result says which one it
// used. With caller-supplied funding events it is external capital: the
// carried-in position's value plus deposits minus withdrawals. Without them it
// falls back to a trades-only proxy — carried-in value plus window buys minus
// the MATCHED proceeds of window sells — which is blind to capital that never
// passed through a trade, so it overstates the return for an account that
// trades a small part of its balance.
//
// External capital movements are time-weighted (Modified Dietz), so capital that
// arrived late in the window counts for less than capital held throughout. Trade
// flows are not: a trade moves capital already inside the account, and weighting
// a sale as capital returned and a later repurchase as capital re-deployed
// collapses the base for an account that only rearranged what it held.

  // Three revisions tried to keep weighting on the trades basis and screen the
  // damage with a threshold. Each failed, because the pathology is intrinsic to
  // weighting internal rearrangements rather than a tail case: measuring the net
  // flow missed the collapse entirely, since an early sell and a late rebuy
  // cancel out of the net; gross weighted flow grew with the number of flow legs
  // instead of the erosion, so it suppressed ordinary round-trip trading while
  // still admitting a collapsed base; and keying on the carried-in value was

  // it. No threshold separates the cases, because on the trades basis the same
