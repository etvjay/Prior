//
// Revoking is the same call with `approved: false` — the registry stores a boolean
// per (owner, operator, selector) slot rather than a grant list, so there is no

/**
 *  Grant or revoke an operator across EVERY pool in the linked pool registry.
 *
 *  **When to use**
 *
 *  When the operator is a piece of infrastructure rather than a per-venue bot — most
 *  concretely `SpotRouter`, which is not on any pool's system-level allowlist and so
 *  can only be admitted this way. `SpotRouter` prescribes exactly this grant with
 *  `[PLACE_ORDER_FOR_SELECTOR]`; without it a swap reverts
 *  `RouterNotApprovedAsOperator`.
 *
 *  Prefer {@link setOperatorApprovalForPool} for a bot that trades one venue — same
 *  admission, far less blast radius.
 *
 *  **Details**
 *
 *  The grant is per `msg.sender`, so the signer is the owner granting. Pass
 *  `approved: false` to revoke.
 *
 *  A global grant only takes effect on pools the linked pool registry has
 *  registered — the registry gates it on `isRegistered(pool)` when resolving. A
 *  per-pool DENIAL still overrides it.
 *
 *  **Gotchas**
 *
 *  "Every pool" includes pools registered AFTER the grant. This is the broad
 *  instrument; scope it by passing only the selectors the operator actually needs.
 *
 * **Example** (Granting and revoking router access)
 *
 *  ```ts
 *  const trader = client.createTrader({ privateKey });
 *  const routerAddress = owner; // stand-in for the SpotRouter address
 *  await trader.setOperatorApprovalGlobal({
 *    operator: routerAddress,
 *    selectors: [PLACE_ORDER_FOR_SELECTOR],
 *    approved: true,
 *  });
 *  // ...swap...
 *  await trader.setOperatorApprovalGlobal({
 *    operator: routerAddress,
 *    selectors: [PLACE_ORDER_FOR_SELECTOR],
 *    approved: false,
 *  });
 *  ```

 *  The OperatorPermissionsRegistry a SpotPool gates its operator calls through, or

 *  **When to use**
 *
 *  To discover the registry address instead of configuring it. Every grant write and
 *  grant read needs that address, and `addresses.operatorPermissionsRegistry`
 *  (`config.ts`) is the only other way to supply it — no deployment manifest carries
 *  the key yet, so a caller who has not set it by hand is refused with
 *  {@link NotConfiguredError}. Ask the pool, then pass the answer as
 *  `operatorRegistry` on a grant write.
 *
 *  **Details**
 *
 *  The POOL is the authority on which registry is binding: the gate inside
 *  `placeOrderFor` / `cancelOrderFor` / `reduceOrderFor` consults this address and no
 *  other, so a grant written anywhere else is inert. Chain tier, one read at chain
 *  head.
 *
 *  This is a discovery path, not a redirection. A caller who HAS configured
 *  `addresses.operatorPermissionsRegistry` keeps using it — the writes and the grant
 *  reads still resolve the configured value, and this read never overrides it.
 *
 *  **Gotchas**
 *
 *  `null` means the pool holds `address(0)` — "legacy mode", in which the pool denies
 *  every operator call. It is a live answer about the pool, not a failed read, and
 *  substituting the zero address for it would produce grant reads that plausibly
 *  answer `false` forever.
 *
 *  Two pools on one deployment may name different registries. Read per pool rather
 *  than caching one answer for all of them.
 *
 *  Failures are the decorated read client's two: `ContractRevertError` when the pool
 *  rejects the call, `RpcError` when the read gets no answer — which is also how an
 *  address that is not a SpotPool at all surfaces, because an empty return is not
 *  classified as a revert. This function needs no configuration of its own, so it does
 *  not itself throw {@link NotConfiguredError} as the grant reads above do; the client
 *  method that wraps it can, because it resolves its chain clients lazily.
