// Series-cadence helpers. A binary up/down market belongs to a rolling series
// with a fixed cadence — 1m, 5m, 15m, 1h, 4h, 24h. The indexer stores that
// cadence in seconds on the Market entity's `intervalSec`: for a MarketCreator
// series it is the TRUE cadence the creator emits (patched from
// MarketCreator.MarketCreated, so even a partial first/bootstrap market reports
// the full cadence); otherwise it falls back to the market's own
// `expiry − tradingStart` window. These are the SDK-canonical helpers for
// resolving it and turning it into the compact human label a trade row / market
// row displays.
//
// This lives here (not in the explorer) so every consumer — the explorer, other
// UIs, bots — reads ONE `intervalSec → "15m"` mapping instead of each
// re-deriving `expiry − tradingStart` and hand-rolling the format. The label is
// also stamped onto every {@link BinaryMarket} the SDK returns (as
// `BinaryMarket.interval`), onto trade-history rows (`FillRow.market` /
// `PortfolioTrade.market`), and onto a wallet's ACTIVE positions + open orders
// (`PortfolioPosition.market` / `PortfolioOrder.market`) so a positions row can
// show its contract duration — so most callers never touch these directly.
